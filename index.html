                                <p>Born in Tamworth, my family moved to Brisbane well before I was infected with a love
                                    of Country Music. I have lived in Brisbane all my life attending High School at a
                                    Catholic Boys School, with chosen electives of Music and Information Technology.</p>
                                <p>I now live with my Wife and two children in the Northern suburb of Brisbane,
                                    Sandgate. My Hobbies include fishing, camping, native Australian aquarium fish, and
                                    a general love of Japanese sports cars. </p>
                                <p>Not a lot of people know that I have been collecting Phantom Comics for most of my
                                    life, though apparently the Phantom has shown up randomly at many a party I have
                                    attended over the years. Unfortunately, I have never been in the room at the same
                                    time so I am unable to confirm this…</p>

                        <div class="sectionContent">
                            <article>
                                <p>I have been interested in IT from a very early age when my father used to bring home
                                    an MSX2 Microcomputer in the late 80's/early 90's. Initially attracted to video
                                    games, I dabbled with programming using BASIC, then learning some simple Turbo
                                    Pascal in high school. After leaving school I achieved a great sense of
                                    accomplishment by solving others IT related problems and providing networking
                                    solutions for friends and family which was typically required for LAN parties. While
                                    living in share houses, I soon realised that I spent more time trying to improve
                                    computers and IT setups than actually using them!</p>
                                <p>Over the last 17 years, I have worked in as an IT Support Technician, Systems
                                    Administrator, Network Administrator and most recently an IT Manager. During this
                                    time, I learnt on the job, either from others or many a late-night, researching
                                    solutions required for the particular task at hand. This way I became very broadly
                                    experienced but feel that I may have skipped over some of the basics and possibly go
                                    for the more complicated solution when there could be an easier way. (For example, I
                                    am rather confident writing complex SQL queries but basic Excel functions elude me).
                                </p>
                                <p>Having briefly attempted University in the late 1990’s, I have always had a goal to
                                    achieve a bachelor’s degree in information technology, though a combination of my
                                    career and family commitments saw this goal drift further away as time went on.
                                    Hopefully, my enrolment with RMIT through open Universities is the answer to this as
                                    I should be able to focus on my end goal one piece at a time. Why bother now when I
                                    am already a successful IT Professional? I can achieve a solution or solve a
                                    problem, but often without knowing the pieces in the middle. I hope that my studies
                                    give me the knowledge of the all the pieces I have skipped over and that this
                                    knowledge allows me to be more effective in my career.</p>

                            <p>My ideal job is the Head of Technology or (Chief Technology Officer) for a progressive
                                company that includes the use of Information Technology in their strategic plan.
                                Another variant of this role is the Chief Information Officer (CIO), the difference
                                being that a CTO is typically in charge of the technology being used externally
                                for a busines such as a product, whereas the CIO oversees how a company uses and
                                protects its information internally. Often in small to medium businesses one role
                                covers both these responsibilities. I believe that being directly involved with the
                                direction of a business at an executive level, would be highly rewarding,
                                not only from a remuneration perspective but also a sense of self achievement </p>

                            <p>Typically, a CTO requires many years of experience in the industry, understand technology
                                trends, and have proven management skills in order to lead a team to success. An

                                to make informed decisions, balancing technology requirements to financial resources.
                                Project management and people skills are also required in order to ensure that required
                                business outcomes are achieved, and staff remain engaged and rewarded for their efforts.
                                As with any leadership role, excellent communications skills and professional business

                                number of these skill required. In fact, in my most recent role I was considered to be
                                in a Head of IT position in a small business as part of the Executive Team reporting to
                                the Managing Director.</p>
                            <p>Although I have no actual qualifications ‘on paper’ I have experience evolving technology
                                and working with team members to progress projects. I have strong communication skills,
                                am very good at problem solving, including an analytical mind that can separate the
                                actual facts from rumour and have experience ensuring that tasks and projects align with
                                a business’s strategic direction.</p>
                            <p>I have experience in Microsoft products from Windows Server 2000 Active Directory through
                                to Microsoft 356, Exchange Online and Azure Active Directory. I have experience in
                                administration of Linux servers, and both managed and performed migrations from on
                                premises infrastructure to cloud based services such as Amazon Web Services. While most
                                of my network administration has been done either on HP Procurve hardware & virtual
                                cloud networks, I have successfully achieved a certification in Cisco Switching &
                                Routing in the past, though this has since expired. During my work history I have also
                                been involved in designing databases to meet business requirements and worked with
                                software developers to implement features for both internal and external product

                                do need to improve in some areas. Notably, budgeting, project management and business
                                planning. My plan to obtain these shortfalls in my skills and experience is actually
                                rather straight forward and simple.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Continue working in The IT industry, finding opportunity to learn new skills</li>
                                <li>Study and obtain a Bachelor of IT, both for learning new skills and as a requirement
                                    for step 3</li>
                                <li>Study and obtain a Masters in IT Management. This is where the high level IT

                                part time in order to continue working in the industry and obviously a requirement to
                                survive financially.</p>

                            <h2>Strong Practical Skills</h2>
                            <p>Consuls are excellent managers of day-to-day tasks and routine maintenance, enjoying
                                making sure that those who are close to them are well cared for</p>
                            <h2>Strong Sense of Duty</h2>
                            <p>People with the Consul personality type have a strong sense of responsibility and strive
                                to meet their obligations, though this may sometimes be more from a sense of social
                                expectations than intrinsic drive</p>
                            <h2>Very Loyal</h2>
                            <p>Valuing stability and security very highly, Consuls are eager to preserve the status quo,
                                which makes them extremely loyal and trustworthy partners and employees. Consuls are
                                true pillars of any groups they belong to – whether it is their family or a community
                                club, people with this personality type can always be relied upon</p>
                            <h2>Sensitive and Warm</h2>
                            <p>Helping to ensure that stability, Consul personalities seek harmony and care deeply about
                                other people’s feelings, being careful not to offend or hurt anybody. Consuls are strong
                                team players, and win-win situations are the stuff smiles are made of</p>
                            <h2>Good at Connecting with Others</h2>
                            <p>These qualities come together to make Consuls social, comfortable and well-liked. Consul
                                personalities have a strong need to “belong”, and have no problem with small talk or
                                following social cues in order to help them take an active role in their communities</p>

                    <div class=sectionContent>
                        <article>
                            <h2>Worried about Their Social Status</h2>
                            <p>These Strengths are related to a chief Weakness: Consuls’ preoccupation with social
                                status and influence, which affects many decisions they make, potentially limiting their
                                creativity and open-mindedness</p>
                            <h2>Inflexible</h2>
                            <p>Consuls place a lot of importance on what is socially acceptable, and can be very
                                cautious, even critical of anything unconventional or outside the mainstream. People
                                with this personality type may also sometimes push their own beliefs too hard in an
                                effort to establish them as mainstream</p>
                            <h2>Reluctant to Innovate or Improvise</h2>
                            <p>Just as they can be critical of others’ “unusual” behavior, Consuls may also be unwilling
                                to step out of their own comfort zones, usually for fear of being (or just appearing)
                                different</p>
                            <h2>Vulnerable to Criticism</h2>
                            <p>It can be especially challenging to change these tendencies because Consuls are so
                                conflict-averse. Consul personalities can become very defensive and hurt if someone,
                                especially a person close to them, criticizes their habits, beliefs or traditions</p>
                            <h2>Often Too Needy</h2>
                            <p>Consuls need to hear and see a great deal of appreciation. If their efforts go unnoticed,
                                people with the Consul personality type may start fishing for compliments, in an attempt
                                to get reassurance of how much they are valued</p>
                            <h2>Too Sefless</h2>
                            <p>The other side of this is that Consuls sometimes try to establish their value with doting
                                attention, something that can quickly overwhelm those who don’t need it, making it
                                ultimately unwelcome. Furthermore, Consuls often neglect their own needs in the process

                            <p>Factor I was labelled as Extroversion by the developers of the IPIP-BFFM. Factor I is
                                sometimes given other names, such as Surgency or Positive Emotionality.
                                Individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who
                                score low tend to be shut ins.</p>
                            <h2>Factor II</h2>
                            <p>Factor II is labeled as Emotional Stability. Factor II is often referred to by other
                                names, such as Neruoticism or Negative Emotionality (in these two cases interpretations
                                are inverted, as Neruoticism and Negative Emotionality can be though of as the opposite
                                of Emotional Stability).</p>
                            <h2>Factor III</h2>
                            <p>Factor III is labeled as Agreeableness. A person high in agreeableness is friendly and
                                optimistic. Low scorers are critical and aggressive</p>
                            <h2>Factor IV</h2>
                            <p>Factor IV is labeled as Conscientiousness. Individuals who score high on this factor are
                                careful and diligent. Low scorers are impulsive and disorganized.</p>
                            <h2>Factor V</h2>
                            <p>Factor V is labeled as Intellect/Imagination. This factor is also often called Openness
                                to Experience.
                                People who score low tend to be traditional and conventional.</p>

                            <p>The results of these tests mostly align with my self view of my personality, though I do
                                believe that our view of ourselves is not often the same as how others see us. In fact
                                different personality types in other people could have completely different views of me.
                                I don’t 100% agree with the MBTI result though, for example I am not worried about my
                                social status and wouldn’t consider myself inflexible. Aside from that, if these results
                                are in fact accurate, then I believe that I would be a valuable asset to any team. I am
                                loyal and agreeable with strong practical skills</p>

                            <p>My project idea is to develop an affordable, scalable aquaponics monitoring and
                                automation solution for back yard hobbyists. Large scale automated systems exist for
                                commercial aqua farming but the cost of these solutions make them unviable for the
                                backyard farmer. Conversely, ‘do it yourself’ style projects for monitoring and
                                automating home aquariums also exist, typically using a Raspberry Pi or Arduino board
                                and other consumer electronics to measure different environment factors and present this
                                information on web-based dashboard. I intend to expand on this idea, targeting
                                environment variables that are core to combining aqua culture and hydroponics, either in
                                a single back yard system or for multiple units on a larger property.</p>

                            <p>Aquarium keeping has been a hobby of mine for most of my life, so I understand the basic
                                science behind water quality and the nitrogen cycle. Combining the nitrogen output of
                                aquarium water to be used as a fertiliser for a hydroponics system seems to me like a
                                fantastic self sufficient and sustainable way to produce food. What I would really like
                                to see is an easy way to monitor what is going on, ensuring that the water is healthy
                                for both the fish involved and ensuring that the plants get the nutrients they need to
                                grow. Any automation would be a bonus value add.</p>

                            <p>For a proof of concept, the project would involve the use of a Raspberry Pi to measure
                                the required environment variables and transmit this information wirelessly to a central
                                server to be logged and presented to a user via a web based dashboard. The information
                                collected over time will be:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Water temperature</li>
                                <li>Water PH</li>
                                <li>Water Levels of both the fish grow tank and the hydroponics bed</li>
                                <li>Nitrate levels of the water, measured both at the fish grow tank and the output of
                                    the hydroponics bed</li>
                                </li>Sunlight</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Additional hardware items could be added to control things such as water top ups and
                                chemical dosages if required. There could even be an automated feeder integrated to
                                allow the hobbyist to go on holiday</p>
                            <p>The central server that logs the information and provides the web-based user interface
                                will have its own logic built in with adjustable constraints. This will allow the user
                                to setup alerts for when things are going wrong. Some examples of these are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Water pump failure. An aquaponics system does not perform well when no water is
                                    circulating.</li>
                                <li>Temperature fluctuations: Not so much an issue for plants, but fish do not deal well
                                    with temperature fluctuations and this typically means there is something else going
                                    on</li>
                                <li>Nitrate Levels: Typically, the nitrate levels of the output of the plant grow bed
                                    should be less than the fish grow tank</li>
                                <li>Water levels: Once again, aquaponics systems do not perform well without enough
                                    water</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Alerting can be setup using basic email alerts, but email alerts are not ideal. They are
                                often lost within other email, picked up as spam or can flood an inbox altogether. As a
                                stretch goal to this project, or even as a future add on, a mobile app could be
                                developed that communicated with the central server. This is where this project could
                                really stand out from other do it yourself solutions. In fact, most of the intellectual
                                property involved would be in the Servers ability to process the appropriate information
                                rather than the hardware itself. Additionally, an easy to use mobile app could in fact
                                be turned into a viable product for commercial aquafarming, given enough consultation
                                within the industry.</p>

                            <p>Currently much of this project can already be done with a combination of readily
                                available open source tools. Reporting and monitoring tools such as Nagios exist which
                                can be deployed to measure temperature from a source device. The Nagios client can be
                                installed on the Raspbian operating system, whilst the Nagios server can be installed on
                                a number of Linux distributions. Addons such as RRDGraph can then display this
                                information. As Nagios is a product more aimed at IT infrastructure, developing a unique
                                solution would require the use of the following tools and Technologies:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A custom communications client and server, most likely written in C</li>
                                <li>A database engine to store definitions of Aquaponics Systems, logs and user credentials
                                    etc..</li>
                                <li>A web server such as Apache or Nginx to serve the web dashboard</li>
                                <li>HTML, CSS, PHP and other web technologies to build the interface</li>
                                <li>A mail server</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Many of the skills required for this project are common among IT enthusiasts, though it
                                is likely an experienced developer would be required to ensure reliability of the end
                                product. Networking skills in both local wireless networks and cloud server security
                                would be required, not only to ensure connectivity but also to protect the project from
                                unwanted intrusions or outages due to denial of service attacks and the like. Although
                                setup of Raspberry Pi & Arduino style devices is fairly straight forward, this project
                                would require some basic knowledge in electronic circuits, soldering and safety.</p>

                            <p>If this project is successful, home aquaponics hobbyists and aspiring entrepreneurs will
                                have a new tool making their life much easier and saving them time due to the lack of
                                manual water quality testing required. This will allow them more time to either spend on
                                other ventures, or allow them to increase their output by adding more tanks and grow
                                beds to their operation. Additionally, making a sustainable farming method easier to
                                understand and manage may get more people involved in an exciting way to progress our
                                farming methods for a better future.</p>
