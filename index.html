                                        <p>Born in Tamworth, my family moved to Brisbane well before I was infected with a love of Country Music.  I have lived in Brisbane all my life attending High School at a Catholic Boys School, with chosen electives of Music and Information Technology.</p>
                                        <p>I now live with my Wife and two children in the Northern suburb of Brisbane, Sandgate.  My Hobbies include fishing, camping, native Australian aquarium fish, and a general love of Japanese sports cars. </p>
                                        <p>Not a lot of people know that I have been collecting Phantom Comics for most of my life, though apparently the Phantom has shown up randomly at many a party I have attended over the years.  Unfortunately, I have never been in the room at the same time so I am unable to confirm this…</p>

                                        <p>I have been interested in IT from a very early age when my father used to bring home an MSX2 Microcomputer in the late 80's/early 90's. Initially attracted to video games, I dabbled with programming using BASIC, then learning some simple Turbo Pascal in high school.  After leaving school I achieved a great sense of accomplishment by solving others IT related problems and providing networking solutions for friends and family which was typically required for LAN parties. While living in share houses, I soon realised that I spent more time trying to improve computers and IT setups than actually using them!</p>
                                        <p>Over the last 17 years, I have worked in as an IT Support Technician, Systems Administrator, Network Administrator and most recently an IT Manager.  During this time, I learnt on the job, either from others or many a late-night, researching solutions required for the particular task at hand.  This way I became very broadly experienced but feel that I may have skipped over some of the basics and possibly go for the more complicated solution when there could be an easier way.  (For example, I am rather confident writing complex SQL queries but basic Excel functions elude me).</p>
                                        <p>Having briefly attempted University in the late 1990’s, I have always had a goal to achieve a bachelor’s degree in information technology, though a combination of my career and family commitments saw this goal drift further away as time went on. Hopefully, my enrolment with RMIT through open Universities is the answer to this as I should be able to focus on my end goal one piece at a time.  Why bother now when I am already a successful IT Professional? I can achieve a solution or solve a problem, but often without knowing the pieces in the middle.  I hope that my studies give me the knowledge of the all the pieces I have skipped over and that this knowledge allows me to be more effective in my career.</p>

                                    <p>My ideal job is the Head of Technology or (Chief Technology Officer) for a progressive company that includes the use of Information Technology in their strategic plan.  Another variant of this role is the Chief Information Officer (CIO), the difference being that a CTO is typically in charge of the technology being used externally for a busines such as a product, whereas the CIO oversees how a company uses and protects its information internally.  Often in small to medium businesses one role covers both these responsibilities.  Shown on the left is a snippet from a CTO role advertised on Seek.  I believe that being directly involved with the direction of a business at an executive level, would be highly rewarding, not only from a remuneration perspective but also a sense of self achievement </p>

                                    <p>Typically, a CTO requires many years of experience in the industry, understand technology trends, and have proven management skills in order to lead a team to success.  An understanding of business practices and budgeting is also required in order to be able to make informed decisions, balancing technology requirements to financial resources.  Project management and people skills are also required in order to ensure that required business outcomes are achieved, and staff remain engaged and rewarded for their efforts.  As with any leadership role, excellent communications skills and professional business manner are a must.</p>

                                    <p>Having worked in a Management role in the Industry for some time, I believe I possess a number of these skill required.  In fact, in my most recent role I was considered to be in a Head of IT position in a small business as part of the Executive Team reporting to the Managing Director.</p>
                                    <p>Although I have no actual qualifications ‘on paper’ I have experience evolving technology and working with team members to progress projects. I have strong communication skills, am very good at problem solving, including an analytical mind that can separate the actual facts from rumour and have experience ensuring that tasks and projects align with a business’s strategic direction.</p>
                                    <p>I have experience in Microsoft products from Windows Server 2000 Active Directory through to Microsoft 356, Exchange Online and Azure Active Directory.  I have experience in administration of Linux servers, and both managed and performed migrations from on premises infrastructure to cloud based services such as Amazon Web Services.  While most of my network administration has been done either on HP Procurve hardware & virtual cloud networks, I have successfully achieved a certification in Cisco Switching & Routing in the past, though this has since expired.  During my work history I have also been involved in designing databases to meet business requirements and worked with software developers to implement features for both internal and external product requirements</p>

                                    <p>With these skills I believe that I am close to being qualified for a Head of IT Role but do need to improve in some areas. Notably, budgeting, project management and business planning.  My plan to obtain these shortfalls in my skills and experience is actually rather straight forward and simple.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Continue working in The IT industry, finding opportunity to learn new skills</li>
                                        <li>Study and obtain a Bachelor of IT, both for learning new skills and as a requirement for step 3</li>
                                        <li>Study and obtain a Masters in IT Management. This is where the high level IT Management skill such as business planning and budgeting will be obtained and proven</li>

                                    <p>All of this is in achievable but will take time, especially given that study will have to be part time in order to continue working in the industry and obviously a requirement to survive financially.</p>
